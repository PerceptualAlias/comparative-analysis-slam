# Comparative Analysis of SLAM Algorithms

## Overview
This project focuses on the **comparative analysis of different Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms**. The aim is to evaluate multiple SLAM approaches on common datasets and compare their performance using standard metrics.

---

## Objectives
- Study and compare different SLAM algorithms
- Evaluate performance using standard datasets
- Analyze accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency
- Present results through quantitative and qualitative analysis

---

## SLAM Algorithms Considered
The project may include analysis of:
- EKF
- LOAM
- GMapping
- ACML
- Cartographer

---

## Datasets
